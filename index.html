<h1>Hi There</h1>
<p>I love playing soccer and enojoy playing the violin or the kacha which is a type of drum. I enjoy watching anime, the big bang theory, and many other shows even though lately I haven't had the time for it. My favorite author is James Patterson. I like learning from others and taking in my personal expierences to advance in this world. I feel like once I'm committed to something I will do it. I'm in the robotics team in my shcool known as Harlem Knights TEAM 1660 and I'm in the business committee as our filmmaker, photographer, and I write essays to help us win awards. I will always push myself to do my best.</p>

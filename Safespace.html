<p>What is sexual harassment? Well sexual harassment is many different things; catcalling, sexual comments, sexual intercourse while the use of drugs are some examples of what sexual harassment may be. We all deserve the right to feel safe in our own city, our own neighborhood. Many apps and websites that focus on sexual harassment are usually support groups to victims of sexual assualt, or only adapt to the issue instead of finding a way to get rid of it or prevent it. As we were doing research we realized that many people have different perspectives on what sexual harassment is. For example, for one person catcalling is sexual harassment but to someone else it isn't. Many people aren't well informed of what sexual harassment is and the negative impact it may have against the victim. Some things such as catcalling are seen in our everyday life that we are used to seeing it or hearing it. While women get harassed, men also get harassed and not many people tend to speak upon it. Both women and men tend to be the person who harass another person which is wrong no matter what. Videos and ads will be created to portray the significance of sexual harassment or assualt. The videos will portray the daily perspective of millions of women; when we get dressed, when it's time to go out, anytime we have to go out. This will show how important it is to stop sexual harassment. Another video idea is the perspective of a mother, daughter, son,wife while they see their son, father, mother, husband harassing an unknown person. People tend to harass a stranger they have to emotional ties with them but if someone were to harm or harass their family member it becomes an issue. </p>
